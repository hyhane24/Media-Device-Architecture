Welcome to the Pong game! Read carefully the following guidelines on how to play. 

If you are the left side game user, you use up/down (on Mac alphabet W/S keys) buttons to control the paddle up and down. 
If you are the right side game user, use left/right (on MAC alphabet A/D keys) buttons to control the paddle up and down.
Check your VSC key configuration to make sure you are controlling the paddles correctly. 

The pong ball will bounce as it collides with your paddle. If you miss a ball and the ball touches the end screen behind your paddle, the opponent gets a point. 
The ball will bounce back once it hits the wall so no worries, continue to try. The game's not over yet. 

If you score (as the opponent misses your pass), the increasing HP bar that tallies your points will apprear on your screen.
If you are the left side user, your HP bar is green. 
If you are the right side user, your HP bar is red. 
Be aware that the HP bar first appears as you make a firt score. Following that the HP bar would increase its width as you go for additional scoring. 

The game ends as one of the players score total of 3 points. When game ends these would happen:

1. The pong would stop moving.
3. The middle line would change its color to the winner's color (if left user wins green, if right wins then red).
2. The winner would have longer HP bar, obviously. 

You can't continue to play the game after it ends as the ball would not move. If you would like to replay, re-compile the game. 

Have fun playing the Pong!
