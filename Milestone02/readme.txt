Gameplay instructions: 

Press start(enter) to begin or press select(back) to read instructions. 

In game state (road background shown), press left and right (A and D) keys to move horizontally. 
Scrolling is enabled based on TA Jenny's suggestion in Milestone 1. 

If you want to pause, press start(enter) key in game state. Press start again to return to game.

Right now, when pressing select in game state, it moves to win state. Press enter to restart game. 
Further logic behind how to move to win/lose screen (other than pressing buttons in the future) can be shown in code files (i.e. lives and jellyfish counts).

Barnacles are implemented as obstacles based on TA Jenny's suggestion, but would be shown in Milestone 3 as well as the levels of game play.

Some of the features are not fully implemented yet. For example, sprite loading is going on and off. 
This is something that would definitely be fixed by Milestone 3. Please refer to the codes if not shown in VBA. 
All attached sprites and images can be viewed in submission zip. 

As always, thank you! :) 

P.S. I am very struggling with milestones compared to labs and homeworks. 
If instructors could please let me know what I am doing wrong here and guide me through the right path, I would truly appreciate it. 
I will keep in mind of all feedbacks when completing Miletsone 3.
