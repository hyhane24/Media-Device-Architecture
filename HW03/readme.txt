Welcome to Pfizer Simulation game!

It is 2021, you are a medical staff vaccinating COVID-19 vaccines to your patients. 
Save your patients from COVID-19!

Here's how you play it: 

1. When you start your game, you will see a gray "Start" screen with a graphic of COVID-19 viruses and an antibody.
    Press Select button (Back button on Mac, depending on your button configuration) to start the game. 

2. You are now viewing the patient's blood stream and the game has begun. You will now see the following components:

    - Stationary antibody (big white circle in the middle)
    - 5 moving COVID-19 viruses (moving red circles)
    - 1 white blood cell (moving small white circle)
    - Gray syringe point 
    - Derma layer of the patient's skin (long red land rectangle at the bottom)

    Here is how you play it. You can use left and right arrow keys (or A or D on Mac, depending on configuration) to move your syringe point. 
    When you press button B (or K on mac), CYAN colored vaccine drops will get released. You can press the button multiple times for multiple releases. 
    Aim to collide the vaccine drops with RED COVID-19 viruses. When you aim it right, that single virus would disappear from screen.
    In addition, as you accurately hit the virus, the CYAN (vaccine) inside the antibody (white circle) would increase in size. Think of this as your HP level. 
    WARNING: If you accidently hit white blood cell (white circle) instead of COVID-19 virus (red circle), you lose. Game over. 
    Don't kill the white blood cell, he's not your enemy :(
    If you get all 5 viruses targeted without hitting the white blood cell, you win the game. 

3. If you see a CYAN screen, that means you won. You have accurately targted all viruses.
    If you see a RED screen, it means you lost. You have destroyed the white blood cell instead of the virus. Oh no!
    CYAN means your patient's blood stread is full of vaccine. Healthy patient! 
    RED means your patient's blood stream is full of COVID-19 viruses, OUCH! HELP! 

4. To replay the game from here, press Select again (or back on MAC). You will be directed to the Start page. 

5. If you want to pause the game while the game is not over yet, press Select. You may resume the game by pressing Select again. 

If you encounter a lag in your game, try shutting down the IDE and restart. This issue should not happen when you are freshly using your IDE but when you compile the game multiple times, lag randomly occurs. 

Have fun with the simulation and remember to stay safe from COVID-19! Good luck doc :)
